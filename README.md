# gruenbeck-softliq
This repo is used for documenting on how one can do DIY maintenance of Gruenbeck Softliq devices

The documentation itself is written in markdown. To build a printable PDF I used the following toolchain.

* VSCode with the markdown-preview-enhanced plugin
* pandoc
* Eisvogel Template
* MiKTeX distribution
